h2. What is it?

A handful of little unrelated niceties that are too small to justify their own plugins.

h2. Methods

h3. confirmation()

Intercepts the click event with a generic (and annoying) confirmation box. Cancels the action per the user's response.

h3. printOnClick()

Intercepts the click event, calls window.print(), and stops the event.

h3. toggleTarget()

Intercepts the click event, uses the elements <code>target</code> attribute as a selector to find an element to toggle, then stops the event.

h3. $.number()

Extracts the number out of a string.
<code>$.number('alsiejflij3.14alsiejf') // 3.14</code>
